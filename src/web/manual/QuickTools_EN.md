# VenusFactory Quick Tools User Guide

## 1. Introduction

Quick Tools is designed for users who need fast, efficient, and straightforward analysis without extensive configuration. It provides a no-code entry point to 4 key prediction tasks:

Intelligent Directed Evolution: AI-Powered Mutation Prediction This tool allows for the rapid scoring and analysis of protein mutations. Simply upload a PDB file or paste the PDB content, and the platform will provide insights into the effects of single or multiple mutations on the protein.

Protein Function Prediction: Leveraging pre-trained models, this module predicts various protein functions from a given amino acid sequence. You can upload a FASTA file or paste the sequence directly to predict properties such as solubility, localization, and more.

Functional Residual Prediction: This module focuses on identifying the function of individual amino acid residues, such as Activity Sites, Binding Sites, Conserved Sites, and Motifs, allowing researchers to precisely map structure-function relationships . Users can paste sequences to target these critical sites.

Physicochemical Property Analysis: This module performs rapid, deterministic calculations based on amino acid composition to determine fundamental properties. These include theoretical pI, molecular weight, Instability Index, and secondary structure content, providing essential data for experimental planning
